# CSECU-repo-curation
I'm just trying to bring all precious works my batchmates, maybe senior and juniors to one place. Thanks.

I'm just curating all the works, I hold no copyright of most of these works. If you want to know more about licensing, please visit the respective repo or try contacting them.

If you want your repo to be placed here, create an issue [mentioning details](https://github.com/maifeeulasad/CSECU-repo-curation/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/00-bug-issue.md). I will take a look, after verifying it will be here.
